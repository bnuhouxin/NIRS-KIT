## EasyTopo
EasyTopo is a toolbox for diffuse optical topography based on a standard brain template (ICBM 
152 nonlinear asymmetric template). It implements 2D angular interpolation in a spherical 
coordinate system. It does not require solving the forward and inverse problems of light 
propagation and thereby is computationally efficient.
