function jset_color_defaults(s);% SEE ...% COLORDEF Set color defaults.%   COLORDEF WHITE or COLORDEF BLACK changes the color defaults on the%   root so that subsequent figures produce plots with a white or%   black axes background color.  The figure background color is%   changed to be a shade of gray and many other defaults are changed%   so that there will be adequate contrast for most plots.%%   COLORDEF NONE will set the defaults to their MATLAB 4 values.%   The most noticable difference is that the axis background is set%   to 'none' so that the axis background and figure background colors%   are the same.  The figure background color is set to black.%%   COLORDEF(FIG,OPTION) changes the defaults of the figure FIG%   based on OPTION.  OPTION can be 'white','black', or 'none'.%   The figure must be cleared first (via CLF) before using this%   variant of COLORDEF.%%   H = COLORDEF('new',OPTION) returns a handle to a new figure%   created with the specified default OPTION.  This form of the%   command is handy in GUI's where you may want to control the%   default environment.  The figure is created with 'visible','off'%   to prevent flashing.%%   See also WHITEBG.%   Copyright (c) 1984-96 by The MathWorks, Inc.%   $Revision: 1.13 $  $Date: 1997/01/23 20:02:22 $colordef(s);
